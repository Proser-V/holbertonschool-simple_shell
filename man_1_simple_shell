.TH SIMPLE_SHELL 1 "April 2025" "simple_shell.v0.02" "simple_shell man page"
.SH NAME
.TP
.BR "simple_shell" " \- a minimalist Unix command-line interpreter written in C."
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a basic command interpreter that reads commands from the standard input
and executes them.
.SH Overview
.B simple_shell
attempts to emulate the behavior of 
.BR "sh".
It ignores command-line options and arguments.
It has two modes of execution: interactive and non-interactive.
Interactive mode is the mode by default, it is initiated by executing the 
.B simple_shell
program.
Non-interactive mode is entered when commands piped into the standard input of 
.BR "simple_shell".
.IR "In interactive mode" ", a prompt is displayed" 
and the program awaits input from the user.
Once a command is executed and an output (if any) is displayed, a new prompt is
displayed and a new input is awaited.
To exit the interactive mode and terminate the program two methods are
available: 
.B EOF
.RB "emulation (" "Ctrl+D" ") and the built-in command " "exit".
.IR "In non-interactive mode" ", no prompt is made, the commands are executed,"
output (if any) is displayed, and the program terminates.
.PP
Features include:
.br
.RS
.TP
\- The first word (token) is taken to be a command, any following words will be taken as arguments for that command.
.TP
\- If the command is not recognized to be a program, or if its arguments are non recognized, an error message is displayed.
.TP
\- Execution of programs with or without arguments.
.TP
\- Accepts absolute and relative paths to the program.
.TP
\- Uses the PATH environment variable to search for the program if the calling command was not a path to it (relative or absolute).
.TP
\- Arguments and options are ignored.
.TP
\- Built-in commands:
.BR exit ,
.BR env.

.SH OPTIONS
This shell does not accept command-line options.
.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
.TP
.B exit
Exits the shell normally.
If an exit status (an integer number) is given (usage:
.B exit int_number
) it exits with the specified status.
.TP
.B env
Print the current environment (a list of all the environment variables).

.SH EXIT STATUS
It returns the exit status of the executed command in non-interactive mode.
In interactive mode it returns the last non-zero exit value of the executed commands, and zero otherwise.
.SH FUNCTIONING
The following table summarizes the internal workflow of 
.B simple_shell
:

.TS
box, tab(:);
c | l | l.
Step : Description (Built-in function) : Description (External function)
_
1 : Display the prompt (in interactive mode) : Display the prompt (in interactive mode)
2 : Read user input using \fBgetline\fR : Read user input using \fBgetline\fR
3 : Tokenize the input line using \fBstrtok\fR : Tokenize the input line using \fBstrtok\fR
4 : Find the built-in corresponding to the command : Find the corresponding executable
5 : Execute directly the function : Create a child process using \fBfork\fR
6 : If "exit" found, end the program directly : Use the child to execute the command with \fBexecve\fR
7 : Else return to step 1 if in interactive mode : Wait for the child process to finish using \fBwait\fR
8 :  : Return to step 1 if in interactive mode, terminate
  :  : program otherwise

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Run the shell in interactive mode:
.EX
user$ ./simple_shell
$
.EE

.TP
Execute a simple command:
.EX
user$ ./simple_shell
$ pwd
/home/user
$
.EE

.TP
Execute a command with arguments:
.EX
user$ ./simple_shell
$ ls -a
. .. .git README.md main.c main.h 
$
.EE

.TP
Use a built-in command:
.EX
user$ ./simple_shell
$ env
(full list of environment variables)
$
.EE

.TP
Exit the shell with a specific status:
.EX
user$ ./simple_shell
$ exit 2
user$
.EE

.TP
Run shell in non-interactive mode:
.EX
user$ echo "pwd" | ./simple_shell
/home/user
user$
.EE
